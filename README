Who made this?
==============
The current plugin code was developed by hackebeil. 
The original code for the plugin, which has been broken since 2013, was developed by Kristoffer Petersson, Phek, G Nyman, and Bsdfish. Thanks to those guys for building the first version of this awesome plugin.
Additionally, the current version of the plugin contains code fragments of the TwitchTV plugin (as a part of temporary hack). So, thanks as well to the developers of the TwitchTV plugin for putting their code out there.
